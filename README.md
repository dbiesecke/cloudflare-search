# Cloudflare Search

English | [中文](./README.zh.md)

> An aggregated search API service based on Cloudflare Workers

> Supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, giving AI assistants (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) real-time web search capabilities

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://sink.proddig.com/cloudflare-search-github)

## Search reliability (1.1.2)

Bing is now included in the default selection. Unconfigured Google is reported as
`disabled` without an upstream request. Each response includes `engine_diagnostics`
with status, duration, HTTP error status and a credential-safe error category.
The default provider deadline is 8 seconds; request configuration is isolated.

```sh
curl "$CF_SEARCH_URL/search?q=Berlin%20techno" -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_SEARCH_TOKEN"
curl "$CF_SEARCH_URL/search?q=Berlin%20techno&engines=bing" -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_SEARCH_TOKEN"
```

See [usage and deployment](docs/usage.md) and the [OpenAPI 3.1.1 contract](openapi.yaml).
Brave now parses current HTML without executing scripts or reusing CAPTCHA cookies.
Set `BRAVE_API_KEY` as a Worker secret to use its official API instead of HTML.
DuckDuckGo accepts reordered attributes, extra classes, nested text and direct or
redirected links. CAPTCHA pages return `blocked`; unknown layouts return
`parser_error`, so neither is reported as an empty successful search.

Install dependencies with `npm ci`, then use `npm run dev` (Node 22+ for Wrangler).
The recorded 2026-10-05 Brave HTML yields 17 results; DuckDuckGo returned an HTTP
202 challenge from this environment. This does not establish production recovery.

## MCP Integration: Use in OpenClaw / Claude Code / AI Agents

With MCP (Model Context Protocol), AI assistants can directly call your search service and get real-time search results.

### Installation and Configuration

#### 1. Deploy the Service

First, follow the guide to [Deploy Cloudflare Search](#installation-methods)

#### 2. Add MCP Server Configuration

Edit your config file ([configuration guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)):

- **OpenClaw**: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- **Claude Code**: `~/.claude/config.json` / `~/.claude.json`
- **Claude Desktop macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Claude Desktop Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"cloudflare-search": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@yrobot/cf-search-mcp"],
			"env": {
				"CF_SEARCH_URL": "https://your-worker.workers.dev",
				"CF_SEARCH_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

**Environment Variables**:

- `CF_SEARCH_URL`: Worker deployment URL (required)
- `CF_SEARCH_TOKEN`: Auth token (required if your Worker has `TOKEN` configured)

#### 3. Verify Installation

- **OpenClaw**: Run `openclaw gateway restart` + `openclaw mcp list` and check that `cloudflare-search` appears
- **Claude Code**:
	- Run `/mcp` in Claude Code, and you should see the `cloudflare-search` tool.
	- Or run `claude mcp list`; seeing `cloudflare-search: npx -y @yrobot/cf-search-mcp@latest - ✓ Connected` means setup is successful

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: One-click Deployment (Recommended)

Click the "Deploy to Cloudflare Workers" button above and follow the prompts.

### Method 2: Use Wrangler CLI

```bash
# 1. Install Wrangler
npm install -g wrangler

Open your Worker URL directly and enter search keywords in the web UI:

```
https://$YOUR-DOMAIN/
```

### Method 2: API Request (GET)

Search using query parameters:

```bash
# Basic search
curl "https://$YOUR-DOMAIN/search?q=cloudflare"

# Specify search engines
curl "https://$YOUR-DOMAIN/search?q=cloudflare&engines=google,brave"

# Use token authentication (if TOKEN env var is configured)
curl "https://$YOUR-DOMAIN/search?q=cloudflare&token=$YOUR-TOKEN"
```

### Method 3: API Request (POST)

Submit search by POST form:

```bash

## Search Engine Notes

### Supported Search Engines

| Engine         | Description                  | Configuration Required          | Enabled by Default |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Google**     | Google Custom Search API     | Requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CX` | yes                |
| **Brave**      | Brave Search API             | -                               | yes                |
| **DuckDuckGo** | DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API | -                             | yes                |
| **Bing**       | Bing Search                  | -                               | no (unstable results) |

### Basic Working Approach

1. **Parallel Requests**: All enabled search engines are requested concurrently to improve response speed
2. **Timeout Control**: Timeout of a single engine does not affect others; default timeout is 3 seconds
3. **Result Aggregation**: Merge all successfully returned results and mark their source engine
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Record unresponsive engines and return partial results instead of failing completely

## Environment Variable Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable Name      | Type     | Default  | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`  | `string` | `"8000"` | Timeout per search engine request (milliseconds)   |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY`   | `string` | `null`   | https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials  |
| `GOOGLE_CX`        | `string` | `null`   | https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/       |
| `TOKEN`            | `string` | `null`   | Access token. Enables auth when configured to prevent abuse |

**Notes**:

- Google Custom Search API free tier is limited to 100 requests per day
- After `TOKEN` is configured, all requests must provide a valid token

### Configuration Methods

#### Method 1: `wrangler.toml` File

Edit the `[vars]` section in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[vars]
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key"
GOOGLE_CX = "your-google-custom-search-cx"
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = "8000"
TOKEN = "your-secret-token-here"
```

#### Method 2: Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to the Worker settings page
2. Find the **Environment Variables** section
3. Add variables and save

## Use Cases

### 1. Aggregated Search Service

Build your own aggregated search API and combine results from multiple search engines:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
	"https://$YOUR-DOMAIN/search?q=javascript&engines=google,brave",
);
const data = await response.json();
console.log(`Found ${data.number_of_results} results`);
```

### 2. Frontend Search Feature

Add search functionality to your website or app:

```javascript
async function search(query) {
	const response = await fetch(
		`https://$YOUR-DOMAIN/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`,
	);
	const data = await response.json();
	return data.results;
}
```

### 3. Data Collection and Analysis

Collect results from multiple search engines for comparative analysis:

```javascript
const engines = ["google", "brave", "duckduckgo"];
const results = await fetch(
	`https://$YOUR-DOMAIN/search?q=AI&engines=${engines.join(",")}`,
);
const data = await results.json();

// Group by engine
const byEngine = data.results.reduce((acc, result) => {
	acc[result.engine] = acc[result.engine] || [];
	acc[result.engine].push(result);
	return acc;
}, {});
```

## MCP Integration

With MCP (Model Context Protocol), AI assistants can directly call your search service and get real-time search results.

## Notes and Reminders

### 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Use a Custom Domain**
	 - The default Cloudflare `*.workers.dev` domain may be inaccessible in some regions
	 - It is **strongly recommended** to bind your own domain for a better access experience
	 - In Worker settings, click **Triggers** > **Add Custom Domain** to add a custom domain

2. **Search Engine Limits**
	 - Google API free tier is limited to 100 requests per day
	 - Other search engines generally do not have strict limits, but please use responsibly
	 - Frequent requests may cause temporary rate limiting

3. **Timeout Settings**
	 - Default timeout per engine is 3 seconds
	 - Can be adjusted with `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`
	 - Do not set it too high to avoid long overall response times

### 🔒 Security Configuration

#### Enable Authentication

1. Configure the `TOKEN` environment variable to protect your service from abuse:

- Configure `TOKEN` in `wrangler.toml`
- Configure `TOKEN` in Cloudflare Worker Dashboard

2. Pass token in requests:

```bash
# Access homepage
https://$YOUR-DOMAIN?token=$YOUR-TOKEN

# Request API with token parameter in query/body
curl "https://$YOUR-DOMAIN/search?q=cloudflare&token=$YOUR-TOKEN"

curl -X POST "https://$YOUR-DOMAIN/search" \
	-d "q=cloudflare" \
	-d "token=$YOUR-TOKEN"
```

## FAQ

### Q: Why do some search engines return empty results?

A: Possible reasons:

- Search engine API is temporarily unavailable or timed out
- No relevant results for the search keyword
- Search engine has rate-limited access
- Google requires API Key configuration before use

You can check the `unresponsive_engines` field in the response to see which engines did not respond.

### Q: How can I improve search speed?

A: Recommendations:

- Reduce the number of enabled search engines and only use the engines you need
- Adjust timeout (`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`) appropriately

### Q: Which engines run by default?

Bing, Google, Brave and DuckDuckGo are selected. Google only runs when both credentials are configured. Other providers execute concurrently, so their failure cannot discard Bing results. Explicit `engines` selection is respected.

### Q: How can I protect the service from abuse?

A: It is recommended to configure the `TOKEN` environment variable to enable authentication:

1. Set `TOKEN = "your-random-token"` in `wrangler.toml`
2. Or add it in Environment Variables in Cloudflare Dashboard
3. After configuration, all requests must provide a valid token

Authentication failure returns a 401 error.
